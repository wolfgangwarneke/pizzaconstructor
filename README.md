#### by Wolfgang Warneke

## Description

This is my custom pizza order form which I made for a project at Epicodus.  A potential customer may choose a pizza set to their own tastes and save it if they'd like to order it again.  (A future version would include storage of these presets via a cookie.)

### SPECIFICATIONS

* Allow customer to select size of pizza they would like.
    EX: Selecting size "extra large" will select "extra large"
* Allow customer to select a first topping.
    EX: Selecting "pepperoni" will return "pepperoni"
* Allow customer to select a second topping if desired.
    EX: Selecting "pepperoni" and "clam chowder" will return both "pepperoni" and "clam chowder" as selected toppings
* Allow customer to select toppings until the unrelenting appetites of their hungry eyes are fully satiated.
    EX: Selecting all of the toppings will correspond with all of the toppings
* Allow customer to select desired style of crust.
    EX: Selecting "Sicilian" will log "Sicilian" as the selected crust
* Deliver the pizza to the customer.  The cost of the pizza that is.
    EX: Heh.  A large, traditional crust pizza, with bacon and broccoli toppings will show to have an estimated cost of $14
* Now there is a shopping cart.
    EX: Okay, I see it.  But there's nothing in it.
* Allow the customer to send their current pizza to a shopping cart.
    EX: A large, traditional crust pizza, with bacon and broccoli toppings will show to have an estimated cost of $14, but will display that all in the shopping cart
* The customer has the option to name their current pizza customization.
* Our valued customer (OVC) is now allowed to save their current named customization to their own custom bank of custom pizza configurations.
  EX: Saving a pizza called "My Very First Pizza" (which is a large, traditional crust pizza, with bacon and broccoli toppings) will add a pizza on the load menu called "My Very First Pizza"
* OVC is now afforded the unique opportunity to load past configurations to the custom pizza window.
  EX: Loading "My Very First Pizza" will fill the form with values corresponding with the original, including "large", "traditional", "bacon" and "broccoli"
* Allow the shopping cart to provide OVC with a convenient selection menu to import a previously defined custom pizza from the user bank.
* Equip the pizza customization window with the power to import prefabricated pizza templates created by our brand's sponsored celebrities and top chefs.
* Custom celebrity pizzas have clever and appetizing names. (Puns, if possible.)
  EX: (Sorry, I can't think of any puns right now)
* Show OVC the cost of any individual pizza in the shopping cart.
* Shopping cart will display a running total of all pizzas in the shopping cart.
  EX: a shopping cart with 4 $15 pizzas will display a total of $60
